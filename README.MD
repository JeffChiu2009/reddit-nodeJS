## How to use Reddit Project

# Reddit Clone project structure

Followed the design pattern use by the Model View Controller. MVC helps to separate the concerns and avoids large architectural bugs which are the biggest drain on the speed of a dev team.

Express and NodeJS to design the interfaces, use inspirations (like Reddit.com!), and keep in mind the rules of a good user interface.

# Bootstrapping Express.js

Ok, we've got user narratives, wireframes, and a plan for the first few features we'll do. Time to get started coding! Remember not to "work ahead", instead always do the absolute minimum work to get what you are working on to function and then move to the next.

1. Create an npm project (hint: `$ npm init`) - remember to make your main file called `server.js`.
1. Bootstrap Express.js. You can use Handlebars or Jade as a templating engine if you like. [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html). Now run your server and get "hello world" to appear.
